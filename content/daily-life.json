      "notes": "Observed dash-to-rest behavior after bathroom and water visits. Respiratory rate rose to about 40-44 after exertion and settled toward 36 with rest; sleeping baseline in nearby windows was around 28-32. Pattern looked stress/exertion-linked rather than persistent respiratory decline.",

      "notes": "Significant overnight storm stress with repeated litter-box visits and crouched lingering posture. Morning RR was around 32-36, then rose to about 40 after fluid session with tremors and less rhythmic breathing, later easing back during sleep. Drooling and nausea cues persisted later in day.",

      "notes": "Morning snapshot was relatively stable with sleeping/rest RR around 28-32 and overnight urination about three times. No active drooling but thick saliva and one faint blood-tinged saliva episode were noted, then resolved. Activity remained low-energy but engaged outdoors.",

      "notes": "After daily fluids, she retreated and avoided interaction, consistent with treatment aversion/decompression behavior. Following uninterrupted nap, RR returned around 32-36. Eating continued in the broader day window despite handling sensitivity and intermittent touch reactivity.",
